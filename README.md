# High-DimensionalStatistics-MachineLearning
#  ACP_Iris: 
The objective is to apply PCA to the iris flower dataset and attempt to reduce the data dimensions from 4 to 2, which means finding the two principal axes.
#  Simple linear regression: 
Objective:
- Determine the regression line of yield as a function of temperature.
- Calculate and interpret the coefficient of determination.
- Calculate the error.
- Add two points (105, 70) and (180, 70) to our dataset and recalculate to determine the impact of the new points on the regression line parameters.
